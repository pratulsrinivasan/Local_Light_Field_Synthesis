### Contents

This repository contains:
1) Local_Light_Field_Synthesis.ipynb Jupyter notebook with an implementation of our algorithm. Note that this code may contain slight updates and modifications to the code used in our paper.

### Dependencies

This code depends on a working installation of Tensorflow and basic Python libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).
